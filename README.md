##Google Earth Engine With PEcAn

# 


The world is experiencing significant, largely anthropogenically induced, environmental change. This will impact on the biological world and we need to be able to forecast its effects. In order to produce such forecasts, ecology needs to become more predictive—to develop the ability to understand how ecological systems will behave in future, changed, conditions. Ecological models are very useful for simulating and analyzing the long-term dynamics and stability properties of complex ecological systems. and allow integrating information from different disciplines as well as analyzing, interpreting and understanding field observations. Moreover, they allow alternative scenarios to be developed, simulated, analyzed, compared, and ranked according to their effect.
The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) (see pecanproject.org) is an integrated ecological bioinformatics toolbox (Dietze et al 2013, LeBauer et al, 2013) allows ecosystem modeling to be more reproducible, automated, and transparent in terms of operations applied to data and make it more comprehensible to researchers. PEcAn is being designed to interface with wide variety of ecosystem models which is capable of integrating a large scale of observational data at different spatial and temporal scales. 
The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform designed to store and process huge data sets (at petabyte-scale) for analysis and ultimate decision making (Kumar & Mutanga, 2018). Following the free availability of Landsat series in 2008, Google archived all the data sets and linked them to the cloud computing engine for open source use. The current archive of data includes those from other satellites, as well as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based vector data sets, social, demographic, weather, digital elevation models, and climate data layers. The easily accessible and user-friendly front-end of GEE provides a convenient environment for interactive data and algorithm development . Applications of GEE include, but are not limited to: mapping forest cover, detecting deforestation, classifying land cover, estimating forest biomass and carbon, mapping urban area expansion, population mapping, changes in agricultural production and forecasting, and rangeland dynamics all over the world and in all disciplines.
An efficient GEE-Pecan link is therefore essential for remote sensing data  and analysis for earth system science and the output for seamless workflow of PEcAn. It will reduce the effort to upload data from GEE from researchers’ part and part and will allow them to use PecAn models with less effort from modeling groups and will make models more accessible the rest of the research community.


# Deliverables

An application and/or set of functions that automates the connection between GEE and the PEcAn workflow using R. Codes will offer different kind of search filters to look for data based on user’s need or PecAn model’s need and send or store data based on user’s need and will be able to visualize  latitude and longitude in GEE map from PEcAn to GEE and vice versa.


#Biographical Information
I am a Graduate research assistant at University Technology Petronas, where he works to develop computer model for Math disabled children in Malaysia through pediatrician, psychologists and neuropsychologist’s feedback. He is also tutor for python programming, IT infrastructure and Green Computing and certified Microsoft technology Associate. 
 I graduated from University Utara Malaysia in Bachelor in information Technology and worked as a web developer in same institute. I also worked as a data science researcher in SBA research, Austria .  People usually focus on money and established career after graduation. Unlike others, I usually work on projects which I believe can have a good impact on society  and the world and that is why I am not committed to a single place or a job. I believe PEcAn is one of such project and that is why I wish to be a part of it.
